# HumanaConsoleApp

This is a console application that targets .Net 5.0

To run:

1. Clone the repo
2. Open the file location from a terminal and run 'dotnet run' (dotnet sdk required)


The application will prompt for a paragraph.
It will return palindrome words, palindrome sentences, list unique words, and prompt for a character input to get all of the words with that character.

At the first prompt type 'exit' to exit or command/ctrl C at any time.
